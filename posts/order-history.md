# How to view your order history


## Goals

Track changes and updates to your order


### Step 1

Click on the order history option on the left hand side of the panel

### Step 2

You will find a list of all the orders that you have placed on the platform.

#### step 2.1
Order ETA – This gives you the estimated number of days that it will take
for to receive your order.

#### step 2.2
Order Status – This tells you at what stage of the order process your order
is at that time. Whenever the order status changes you will also receive
an email notification.
(I think we need to create a thing where student see
what the order status actually means.)

#### step 2.3
Edit Order – This section allows you to cancel the order or return the
product. If you want to change the details of the order you need to cancel
and place a new order. For example you want to change the tittle, edition,
or ISBN of a book, you must cancel the order and place a new order.
